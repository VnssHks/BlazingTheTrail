# [Blazing The Trail](https://blazing-the-trail-vnsshks.vercel.app) - Creating a Customisable Web Map for Yellowstone and Grand Canyon National Parks
_A Master Thesis Exploration of user-specific web maps of Yellowstone and Grand Canyon NP_

As part of the [International Master of Cartography](https://cartographymaster.eu), this master thesis was written with [ITC](https://www.itc.nl) in the Netherlands, with the help of my supervisor [Dr. rer. nat. Franz-Benjamin Mocnik](https://mocnik-science.net). 

## Abstract
This thesis aims to establish a versatile map interface that caters to the distinct needs and preferences of visitors in the contexts of Yellowstone and Grand Canyon National Parks. The research initiates by developing a temporary web map for Yellowstone National Park using a trial-and-error approach. The study culminates in an extensive user analysis that examines the interface’s intuitive features, usefulness, and aesthetics. Despite the limitation of having only 20 participants, the research’s findings have significant implications for refining the interface. The recommendations shared by participants underline the importance of enhancing interface features, including incorporating aspects such as hiking trails and environmental factors, for example, crowd density and optimal viewpoints. The study finds evidence of a preference for customisation, highlighting the significance of offering both personalised filtering and predefined map settings. The research reveals that interface comprehension is generally favourable but specific areas of ambiguity, such as button functionality and element visibility, were identified. It is important to note that participants showed a varied interest in the onboarding tutorial. Furthermore, participants’ expectations are aligned with the actual element functionalities, validating the initial design's coherence and inherent user-friendliness. The scope of the study goes beyond interface intricacies to explore the broader utility of the map, revealing its effectiveness in proactive trip planning and spontaneous exploration. It can assist in pinpointing attractions and aiding tourism entities. Of notable importance is the perceived usefulness for travel planning, thus supporting the primary goal of the project. These findings reveal the mutually beneficial relationship between user engagement and design innovation, providing valuable insights into adaptable map interface development. To reinforce these scientific findings, the study advocates a circular conceptual framework that includes Knowledge, Preparation, Application, Evaluation, and Review stages, thereby mapping out a systematic process for developing adaptable and user-friendly map interfaces. Incorporating user feedback into actionable design paradigms emphasises the iterative nature that underpins interface evolution. This study provides a prototype for crafting user-centric interfaces that enhance the experiential dimension of trip planning. The framework provides a first foundational foothold while anticipating the accommodation of technological shifts and evolving user preferences, fostering sustained user engagement, and immersive exploration within natural enclaves such as national parks.
