# [Blazing The Trail Version 2.0](https://blazing-the-trail-vnsshks.vercel.app) - Creating a Customisable Web Map for Yellowstone and Grand Canyon National Parks
_A Master Thesis Exploration of user-specific web maps of Yellowstone and Grand Canyon NP_

As part of the [International Master of Cartography](https://cartographymaster.eu), this master thesis was written with [ITC](https://www.itc.nl) in the Netherlands, with the help of my supervisor [Univ.-Prof. Dr. Franz-Benjamin Mocnik](https://mocnik-science.net). 

## Abstract
This thesis aims to establish a versatile map interface that caters to the distinct needs and preferences of visitors in the contexts of Yellowstone and Grand Canyon National Parks. The research initiates by developing a temporary web map for Yellowstone National Park using a trial-and-error approach. The study culminates in an extensive user analysis that examines the interface’s intuitive features, usefulness, and aesthetics. Despite the limitation of having only 20 participants, the research’s findings have significant implications for refining the interface. The recommendations shared by participants underline the importance of enhancing interface features, including incorporating aspects such as hiking trails and environmental factors, for example, crowd density and optimal viewpoints. The study finds evidence of a preference for customisation, highlighting the significance of offering both personalised filtering and predefined map settings. The research reveals that interface comprehension is generally favourable but specific areas of ambiguity, such as button functionality and element visibility, were identified. It is important to note that participants showed a varied interest in the onboarding tutorial. Furthermore, participants’ expectations are aligned with the actual element functionalities, validating the initial design's coherence and inherent user-friendliness. The scope of the study goes beyond interface intricacies to explore the broader utility of the map, revealing its effectiveness in proactive trip planning and spontaneous exploration. It can assist in pinpointing attractions and aiding tourism entities. Of notable importance is the perceived usefulness for travel planning, thus supporting the primary goal of the project. These findings reveal the mutually beneficial relationship between user engagement and design innovation, providing valuable insights into adaptable map interface development. To reinforce these scientific findings, the study advocates a circular conceptual framework that includes Knowledge, Preparation, Application, Evaluation, and Review stages, thereby mapping out a systematic process for developing adaptable and user-friendly map interfaces. Incorporating user feedback into actionable design paradigms emphasises the iterative nature that underpins interface evolution. This study provides a prototype for crafting user-centric interfaces that enhance the experiential dimension of trip planning. The framework provides a first foundational foothold while anticipating the accommodation of technological shifts and evolving user preferences, fostering sustained user engagement, and immersive exploration within natural enclaves such as national parks.

## Key Features
- Individual filtering, tailored to each visitor
- Predefined filtering, based on [Benson et al. (2013)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256101414_Who_Visits_a_National_Park_and_What_do_They_Get_Out_of_It_A_Joint_Visitor_Cluster_Analysis_and_Travel_Cost_Model_for_Yellowstone_National_Park)
- Alerts API with the current alerts for each park
- Button that helps navigate between the parks

## Future Work
Future work includes the implementation of several extra features to the web map that could not be done due to timely restrictions. Since the user study only involved the preliminary map for Yellowstone NP, and Grand Canyon NP was added only once the user study was done, more user-centred research is required to understand whether the design of the two maps is adequate, now that a first round of results, suggestions, and remarks was taken into account. Platial similarities and dissimilarities were taken into account based off of a short review of both parks, and implemented using a trial-and-error approach, therefore further research into the cartographic depiction of these parks with the adaptable interface in mind will need to be done in the future. Additionally, filtering algorithms were created with the values for Yellowstone NP in mind, since the parks do greatly differ in topography and relief, research should be done to determine whether it is feasible to use the same algorithms, or whether they should be adjusted to each NP. While many suggestions from the user study were taken into account, some of them could not be implemented in time. Future work on the map should include providing the user with the opportunity to save the map as a pdf or png file and building an onboarding tutorial to help users with the first interaction with the map. Additionally, the map, as it is programmed right now, uses separate algorithms and buttons for the national parks. With more time and resources, one may take into consideration to build the website, so that more parks can be added more easily, without creating a new button and filtering algorithm within the code. 
Future research endeavours should aim to enhance and refine the conceptual framework through rigorous testing and expansion. Currently anchored in research focused on national parks in the United States, its generalisability could be bolstered by investigating users’ preferences and requirements in various global national parks. Furthermore, broadening the scope to encompass diverse settings like urban city centres or public parks would contribute to its broader applicability. The overarching goal is for the conceptual framework to transcend specific contexts, becoming a versatile tool applicable to a wide array of destinations. Ultimately, this study aspires to usher in a new era of map interface design, where the foundation is rooted in users’ aspirations and preferences, thus enhancing both accessibility and enjoyment of diverse destinations.
